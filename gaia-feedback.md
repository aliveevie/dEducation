# Feedback on Gaia Documentation & Developer Experience

Firstly, I'd like to commend the Gaia team for building an ambitious and promising platform. The vision behind Gaia is compelling, and the documentation is neatly organized and accessible. However, after extensively exploring the docs and testing the API, I encountered several critical issues that I believe, if addressed, would significantly improve the developer experience and accessibility of Gaia.

## 1. Lack of End-to-End Example in Quickstart and Docs

The documentation currently lacks a complete, working example of how to create an AI agentâ€”from setup to execution. The Quickstart guide mentions components but doesn't walk users through an actual use case with sample code that demonstrates a functioning agent in practice.

### Suggestion:

Include a step-by-step tutorial (both in text and video form) that walks a developer through:

- Creating a basic agent using Gaia.
- Using the API to interact with the agent.
- Handling responses and errors properly.

This would drastically reduce the barrier to entry and help developers build with more confidence.

## 2. Excessive Hardware Requirement Without Alternatives

The current requirement for running a local node is a machine with at least 16GB of RAM, which is far from ideal for most developers, especially those working on lightweight setups or cloud-based IDEs.

### Suggestion:

- Provide a cloud-hosted node or offer Dockerized lightweight alternatives.
- At the very least, mention if testnet RPC endpoints or community nodes are available for development purposes.
- A detailed comparison between running locally vs. accessing a hosted Gaia node would help users make informed choices.

## 3. No Working Example of an App Using the API

I attempted to build an app using the Gaia API, carefully following the documentation, but each attempt failed with the same error:

```
Gaia API Error: 404 - {"error":"Gaia API Error: 404","details":{"title":"Not found","description":"Domain is unavailable"}}
```

This persistent error seems to point to either an issue in the API backend or insufficient guidance in the docs. There's also no public example of a fully working application that integrates Gaia's API successfully.

### Suggestion:

- Include a live demo or open-source sample project that integrates the Gaia API.
- Add a detailed troubleshooting section in the docs with known errors and fixes.
- Clarify any required configuration (e.g., whitelisted domains, API key setup, or domain mapping) to avoid such API errors.

## 4. Error Messages Lack Clarity and Troubleshooting Guidance

The error message "Domain is unavailable" is vague. New developers have no idea if it's a configuration issue, a server-side bug, or a domain registration problem.

### Suggestion:

Update error messages to include links to relevant troubleshooting docs or explain the likely cause more clearly. Adding an FAQ section specifically for common API errors would be invaluable.

## 5. No Alternative to Complex Setup

Given how promising Gaia is, it's unfortunate that the current setup is quite complex, which deters quick experimentation.

### Suggestion:

Offer a "no-code" or "low-code" playground where users can try Gaia agents directly in the browser. A hosted agent editor with deployment capability would showcase the platform's power without requiring full setup.

## Final Thoughts

Gaia has great potential, but a developer-first approach will be key to its growth. Right now, the lack of practical examples, steep resource requirements, and confusing error handling are significant blockers. Addressing these issues could make Gaia one of the most accessible and exciting platforms in the AI agent space.

Thank you for the opportunity to share this feedback. I hope it proves helpful in improving Gaia for all developers.

Best regards,
